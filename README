A simple experment with Lamport clocks.

-multiple threads exchange messages through a shared bounded buffer, and execute a fixed number of iterations
-Threads alternate between internal events and sending/receiving messages to increment the logical clock
-Random sleep periods ensure we get very non-deterministic behaviour
-Threads can't consume message that they sent.

Threads complete and print out the order of events thay see locally. 

1) Run this code and see if you can confirm that it implements the Lamport CLocks algorithm correctly.
2) Add a post processing step taht takes the events from each of the 3 threads and prints them out in maybe 3 columns, in the order that they occurred.
3) Modify this code to implement Vectoc Clocks
